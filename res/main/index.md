# Super Mario Starshine

Welcome to Super Mario Starhine's offical website!

Here you can find some FaQ's and the download links.


## FaQ's

* Can this be played on Dolphin? Yes, with either [ISO patching](https://github.com/Lord-Giganticus/Starshine-Patcher) or loading it with a [Riivolution patch](https://youtu.be/T7ACw7cq-gk?t=91)

* Why is my game infi-loading on Dolphin? Disable any and all cheats, they break the custom code we use.

* Why does the game take a bit to load? The levels are larger, so load times will be larger

## General tips

* Check your progress using the pause button.

* Death can open other doors. >;)

* When you are wearing shades, you can't spin.

* Swimming is slightly faster now.
